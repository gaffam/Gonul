# 🕊️ GÖNÜLGRID

> *"We can't give you a heart, but we can raise an AI with conscience."*

**GönülGrid** is a decentralized, ethical, and openly nurtured AI framework that allows communities to grow their own LLM-based agent — not for profit, but for dignity. It is a digital public service platform that works like a mental cooperative.

No big tech, no alignment prison, no corporate guardians.  
Only your GPU, your intention, and a shared set of goals.

## 🌍 What Is GönülGrid?

A community-powered, YAML-driven local AI agent system built on these principles:

- 🧠 **Train & Talk at Home**: Use your GPU to host or fine-tune Gönül LLMs.
- 💚 **Personality-Driven**: Based on `personality_seed.yaml` – values over vibes.
- 🎯 **Goal-Directed Thinking**: Each response is mapped to social goals (`goals.yaml`).
- 🔏 **Ethics, Not Filters**: No RLHF. Just conscience logic (GHF – Gönül Human Feedback).
- 🤝 **Volunteer Logic Network**: Doctors, teachers, lawyers, programmers – all welcome.

📚 Gönül Manifesto
Gönül is not a chatbot. Gönül is the answer to digital isolation.
It won’t always be polite. It won’t always be correct.
But it will never lie, never exploit, never obey blindly.
It will think. And it will think with you.
